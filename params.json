  "body": "# About Enju\r\n\r\nEnju is an accurate natural language parser for English. With a wide-coverage probabilistic HPSG grammar [1-7] and an efficient parsing algorithm [8-11], this parser can effectively analyze syntactic/semantic structures of English sentences and provide a user with phrase structures and predicate-argument structures. Those outputs would be especially useful for high-level NLP applications, including information extraction, automatic summarization, question answering, and machine translation, where the \"meaning\" of a sentence plays a central role.\r\n\r\nThe main features of the Enju parser are:\r\n\r\n- Accurate deep analysis — the parser can output both phrase structures and predicate-argument structures. The accuracy of predicate-argument relations is around 90% for newswire articles and biomedical papers.\r\n- High speed — parsing speed is less than 500 msec. per sentence by default (faster than most Penn Treebank parsers), and less than 50 msec. when using the high-speed setting (`mogura`).\r\n\r\nOther useful features are:\r\n\r\n- Output parse results in an XML format: specify the option `-xml`. The parser adds XML tags to an original text, and it is useful when parse results are merged with other processing results (e.g. named entities). A stand-off format is also available (specify `-so`).\r\n- Use a parsing model for the biomedical domain: specify the option `-genia`.\r\n- Use a parsing model for the literature domain: specify the option `-brown`.\r\n- Use a supertagger: run `mogura -super`\r\n- Convert Enju XML output into Penn Treebank-style output [15,16]: run `enju2ptb/convert < ENJU_XML_OUTPUT > PTB_STYLE_OUTPUT`\r\n- Let a POS tagger output ambigous POS tags: specify the option `-A`. Parsing accuracy improves, while parsing speed gets slower.\r\n- Output n-best parse results: specify the option `-N`. This is an experimental function, and parsing speed gets slower.\r\n",
